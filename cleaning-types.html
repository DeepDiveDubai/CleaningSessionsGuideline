          <h3 class="section__title">Green Algea Cleaning</h3>
          <p>Green algeas are not good for pool conditions. They should be clean by brush with vacuuming in same time.</p>
          <p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Brushing should be slow enough to catch all the algeas. Otherwise algeas spread out all over the pool and start to grow there.</p>
